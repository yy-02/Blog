# My Research Interests  

I'm now doing research about how to use [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) & [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_reinforcement_learning) to improve the effect of [PID-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) in self-balance robot. 

I'm still a freshman in research, so most of articles in my blog will be the reading summaries of papers I've read.
